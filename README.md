# Calculator
Calculator made using Python. Using random, math, and time, we were able to create this well-optimized non-GUI calculator. Hope you enjoy!
Please ensure that you download all the assets at the front; otherwise, it will not work. The .EXE should be located in the dist folder.
I don't know why it's saying it was made mostly in HTML when I only used python in this project.
