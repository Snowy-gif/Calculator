# Calculator
Calculator made using Python. Using random, math, and time, we were able to create this well-optimized non-GUI calculator. Hope you enjoy!
Please download the zip file and go into the dist folder, and run the .EXE from there. Downloading the .EXE as a standalone will not work.
I don't know why it's saying it was made mostly in HTML when I only used python in this project.
